food -> data
waiter -> API
order -> API request sent to the server
send to kitchen -> API is sent to the server
food storage kitchen -> data base
kitchen -> server
food processens -> data processing happens
star -> browser
tabel -> browser
waiter would be having differnt quisine order -> API would be having different kinds of request(GET, POST, DELETE, UPDATE, UPSERT, etc)
chicken kabab, beef kabab -> getProduct, getAllProduct, getProductById 
waiter's note -> request object
waiter puts the note before chef, chef process the order -> request object goes to the server and handler function process the request
chef -> handler function
prepared hot food -> response object sent by the server
food in a bowl, or plate, or a tray -> response in a json format, in a text format
order written in notes -> API endpoint acociated with the request.
If a customer wants to oder a chicken kabab, -> waiter takes his order and writes it down in a note and sends it to the chef. -> chef comes and confirms that the customer is a not a vegan.

i. If route has two handler functions
sequence of execution of the handler functions
first handler function -> second handler function by using next()

ii. To every handler fuction, three parameters are passed
1 req -> request object : It contains the data sent by the client(frontend) to the server.
2 res -> response object : It contains the data sent by the server to the client(frontend).
3 next -> function to call the next handler function in the sequence.

callback function -> function that is passed as an argument to another function.

if steve makes a promise to return back the borrowed money and he is not able to keep it, then he is a liar.
Promise
if steve is tryinng -> the promise is pending.
steve kept the promise -> the promise is resolved.
steve is not able to keep the promise -> the promise is rejected.
if steve fullfils the promise, the outcome is he is truthful person -> the promise is resolved, data passed to resolved callback function is returned.
if steve is not able to keep the promise, the outcome is he is a liar -> the promise is rejected, data passed to reject callback function is returned.
if steve is able to keep the promise or not would be decided by a third person -> the promise is resolved or rejected is decided by the if condition.
if steve is making a new promise -> we are creating a promise by using new Promise constructor.

new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    // do something
    if (success) {
        resolve(data);
    } else {
        reject(error);
    }
});

.
. wait for the promise to be resolved or rejected.  true or false, await to the promise

Simpler term
-> Git is a tool that helps you keep track of changes in your code, while GitHub is a website where you can store and share your code with others.

ii. what is git clone?
-> Git clone is a command used to create a copy of a remote Git repository on your local machine. It downloads all the files, branches, and 
commit history from the remote repository(repository in GitHub) to your local machine.
cammand: git clone <repository-url>

5. Pushed: The committed changes have been pushed to the remote repository.


Examlple:
afham  star   git repository

repository has three branches main, dev, feature
start is working on dev branch and he has made some changes in the code and he wants to push the changes to the remote repository.
